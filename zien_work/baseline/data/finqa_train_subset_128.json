these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .\nbased upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2012 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 3.86% ( 3.86 % ) were 30-89 days

terms may be classified as tdrs .\nadditional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .\na temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date .\na permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .\npermanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .\nfor consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .\nexamples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .\npermanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .\nresidential mortgage and home equity loans

the firm 2019s credit ratings .\nthe firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies .\na downgrade by any one rating agency , depending on the agency 2019s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade , may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies .\nthe table below presents the aggregate fair value of net derivative liabilities under such agreements ( excluding application of collateral posted to reduce these liabilities ) , the related aggregate fair value of the assets posted as collateral , and the additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade in the firm 2019s credit ratings. .\n\n[TABLE]\n\n$ in millions | as of december 2014 | as of december 2013\n--- | --- | ---\nnet

transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market- making and investing and lending activities .\ncredit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position .\ncredit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions .\ncredit events include failure to pay , bankruptcy , acceleration of indebtedness , restructuring , repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity .\ncredit default swaps .\nsingle-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds , loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event .\nthe buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract .\nif there is no credit event , as defined in the contract , the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection .\nhowever , if a credit event occurs , the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection , which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract .\ncredit indices , baskets and tranches .\ncredit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index .\nif a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations , the protection seller pays the protection buyer .\nthe payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation .\nin certain transactions , the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ) , each having different levels of subordination .\nthe most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches , any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure .\ntotal return swaps .\na total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller .\ntypically , the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation , and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation , plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation .\n132 goldman sachs 2014 annual report .\n\nQuestion: in millions

but do not hold the first lien .\nlien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination .\nhowever , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied .\ntherefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien .\nadditionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien .\nthis updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources .\nwe track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold .\nthis information is used for internal reporting and risk

bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) .\nin establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans .\nin accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses .\nthe roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off .\nthe roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual

a business under asc 805 .\nthe purchase price was comprised of an $ 84.8 million cash payment , which was net of certain adjustments , plus three contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional $ 250.0 million in cash .\nthe contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition as follows : six months after acquisition , 12 months after acquisition , and 24 months after acquisition .\npursuant to asc 805 , the company recorded its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability

non-performance risk related to the liability pursuant to asc 820 .\nthis analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of $ 29.5 million , which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in the fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to

, the borrower 2019s current credit score and other credit bureau attributes , in addition to each loan 2019s individual default experience and credit characteristics , are incorporated into the calculation of the specific allowance .\na specific allowance is established to the extent that the recorded investment exceeds the discounted cash flows of a tdr with a corresponding charge to

inherent in the loan portfolio .\nin the current market it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in the quantitative and qualitative factors , including the impact of home equity lines of credit converting from interest only to amortizing loans or requiring borrowers to repay the loan in full at the end of the draw period , might impact the allowance for loan losses .\nif our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses .\nwe may be required under such circumstances to further

aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research , design , development , manufacture , integration , sustainment , support , and upgrade of advanced military aircraft , including combat and air mobility aircraft , unmanned air vehicles , and related technologies .\naeronautics 2019 major programs include the f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter , f-22 raptor , f-16 fighting falcon , c-130 hercules , and the c-5m super galaxy .\naeronautics 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .\n\n[TABLE]\n\n | 2012 | 2011 | 2010\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nnet sales | $

approximately $ 745 million from f-35 lrip contracts principally due to increased production volume ; about $ 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries ( 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 ) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers ; and approximately $ 140 million from c-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries ( four c-5m aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011 ) .\npartially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 110 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume ; and about $ 95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume .\nnet sales for c-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries .\naeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $ 69 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 .\nthe increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements ; about $ 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million from f-35 lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; and about $ 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts .\npartially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $ 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception- to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 ; and approximately $ 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume .\noperating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 .\nadjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 .\n2011 compared to 2010 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2011 increased $ 1.3 billion , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 .\nthe growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $ 850 million for work performed on the f-35 lrip contracts as production increased ; higher volume of about $ 745 million for c-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries ( 33 c-130j aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010 ) and support activities ; about $ 425 million for f-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries ( 22 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010 ) ; and approximately $ 90 million for higher volume on c-5 programs ( two c-5m aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010 ) .\nthese increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $ 675 million due to lower volume on the f-22 program and lower net sales of about $ 155 million for the f-35 development contract as development work decreased. .\n\nQuestion: what is the growth rate in operating profit for aeronautics in 2011?\nPlease provide step-by-step reasoning and then give your final answer in the format '####

billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 .\nthis increase was mainly due to higher levels of non-u.s .\ntransaction accounts associated with the growth of new and existing business in assets

the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions .\nseveral factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin , including the mix of client liabilities ; actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s .\nand non-u.s .\ninterest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured .\nbased on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay- downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s .\ntreasury and agency securities ,
